# Payment Gateway Adapter System

A robust, extensible Go-based payment gateway adapter that normalizes interactions with multiple payment providers into a unified interface.

Built to handle varying response formats, error structures, and operational behaviors - while being easily extendable for future providers.

## Features

- Unified API: Single interface to process payments across providers
- Response Normalization: Diverse provider responses mapped to a consistent internal model
- Error Standardization: Provider-specific errors converted to a common `Error` interface with structured metadata
- Extensible Design: Add new providers via interface implementation
- Production-Ready Patterns: Adapter pattern, interface abstraction, proper error handling
